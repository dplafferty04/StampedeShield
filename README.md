# StampedeShield

Welcome to Stampede Shield!

This is an application for crowd monitoring and implements opencv and YoloV8 to achieve this!

To demo this, two terminals running simaltenously is required

Terminal 1:
cd into the "backend" directory and paste:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Terminal 2:
cd into the "frontend" directory and paste:
npm run build
npm start

Now you can run the application!
Either use an input from a camera or upload a video and see the results for yourself!
